# Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of the **Bass Diffusion Model** to predict the adoption of an innovation, specifically focusing on **Affirm** using historical data from **Klarna**. The goal is to model how innovations like **Affirm** spread over time, both in terms of cumulative adoption and new adopters per period (monthly).

### What We Did:
1. **Cumulative Adoption**: We analyzed Klarna's adoption data to understand its growth over time. Using this data, we applied the **Bass Model** to forecast future adoption for Affirm.
   
2. **Bass Model Fitting**: We estimated the parameters \( p \) (coefficient of innovation), \( q \) (coefficient of imitation), and \( M \) (market potential) based on Klarna's historical adoption data.

3. **Forecasting New Adopters**: We predicted the **new adopters per period** (monthly) for **Affirm**, based on the fitted model. The forecast covers a period of **3 years** (36 months).

4. **Visualization**: We visualized the predicted **cumulative adoption** and **new adopters per period**, which showed a smooth adoption curve typical of the **Bass Model**.

### Key Features:
- **Data Analysis**: Historical adoption data from Klarna was used as a basis for modeling future adoption.
- **Forecasting**: The Bass Diffusion Model was used to predict the number of adopters over the next 3 years.
- **Visualization**: Graphs were generated to visualize both **cumulative adoption** and **new adopters per period**.

This project can be useful for understanding how innovations spread over time and can be adapted to model the diffusion of other products or services.
